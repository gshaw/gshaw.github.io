### Ingredients

- 1¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 cup cottage cheese
- 3 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted and cooled
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup, plus more for serving
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Steps

1. In a large bowl, combine the flour and baking powder and whisk together.

2. Add the cottage cheese, eggs, and milk to a blender and blend until smooth.

3. Add the blended ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir gently.

4. Stir in the coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla.

5. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat, scoop batter into the pan and cook until the edges are dry and bubbles begin to form on the pancake.

6. Flip the pancake and cook until the top is softened and the pancake is cooked through, about 1-2 minutes.

7. Stack cooked pancakes on top of one another to keep warm. Top with syrup and enjoy.

### Tips

- Allow the coconut oil to cool before adding it to the batter. Hot coconut oil added to cold ingredients causes it to clump up and won't incorporate well.
- When adding the wet ingredients to the dry, stir gently to combine them. Overmixed pancake batter can lead to tough, flat pancakes.
- After you flip the pancakes, you'll know when they're cooked through when the tops begin to soften.
- Makes about 12 pancakes total.
- Store cooled leftover pancakes in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days, or freeze up to 2 months.
