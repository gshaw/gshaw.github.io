### Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons minced ginger
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon pepper
- 4 cardamom pods
- 1 tablespoon mustard seeds
- 2 cloves
- 3 or 4 rhubarb stalks, strings removed, chopped
- 1 cup dried red lentils, rinsed
- 1 quart vegetable stock or water
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish

### Steps

1. Put the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. When it’s hot, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for another minute. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper.

2. Add the cardamom pods, mustard seeds, and cloves. Cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the rhubarb and lentils. Add the stock and bring to a boil; turn the heat down so the soup bubbles gently but steadily.

3. Cover the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until the lentils and vegetables become almost smooth, 30 to 35 minutes; add water as necessary to keep the mixture brothy. Taste, adjust the seasoning, fish out the whole spices if you like, and serve, garnished with the cilantro.

### More Ideas

- If you can’t find red lentils easily, you can make this soup with brown or green lentils instead.
- Some other fruits to try instead of the rhubarb are peaches, plums, apricots, or tomatoes.
