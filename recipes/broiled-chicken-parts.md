### Ingredients

- 5 sprigs fresh oregano, parsley, or thyme or a combination
- 1 whole cut-up chicken or about 3 pounds parts
- Juice of 2 lemons
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 lemon, quartered, for serving

### Steps

1. Either prepare a grill for indirect cooking so that there are hot coals on half and nothing on the other half and put the rack about 4 inches from the heat source or turn the broiler to high and put the rack about 6 inches from the heat source.

2. Pull the herb leaves from the stems with your fingers and discard the stems. Reserve a pinch of the leaves to use as a garnish.

3. Put your fingers between the skin and the meat of each piece of chicken to loosen the skin; insert a few leaves of the herb between the skin and the meat. Rub the chicken all over with the lemon juice and sprinkle it generously with salt and pepper.

4. Put the chicken skin side down on a rimmed baking sheet and broil, checking every few minutes to make sure the pieces do not burn. If they are cooking too fast, move the rack farther away from the heat source. When the chicken is nearly done, after 15 to 20 minutes, turn the pieces with tongs and cook until the skin is brown, 5 to 10 minutes longer. Whether you broil or grill, to check for doneness, cut into a piece close to the bone with a sharp, thin-bladed knife; the juices should run clear.

5. While the chicken is cooking, chop the reserved herb leaves. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature, garnished with the chopped herbs and lemon wedges.

### Tips

Trust your nose when you grill or broil bone-in, skin-on chicken: If it smells like it's burning, it isâ€”which usually means the outside will be charred while the inside is still raw. It's better to start with the skin away from the heat source and make sure the chicken is cooked through, then crisp the skin as the last step.
