### Ingredients

- ¼ cup of sun-dried tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil (not needed if tomatoes are packed in oil)
- 1 small onion, sliced
- 4 zucchini, chopped (about 8 cups)
- 1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
- Black pepper to taste
- ¼ cup fresh basil, mint, or parsley, or 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary, thyme, or tarragon (optional)
- 6 large eggs
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese

### Steps

1. Put the sun-dried tomatoes in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally so the oil melts from the tomatoes.  Don't let them burn, this step only takes a couple of minutes and is mostly used to get the oil out of the tomatoes to be used to cook the veggies.
2. Add the olive oil (if needed) to the skillet. When the oil is hot, add the onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until it softens, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the zucchini, sprinkle with ½ teaspoon salt and some pepper, raise the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until it just softens, 5 to 10 minutes. Adjust the heat so the zucchini dries and browns a little without scorching. When the zucchini is completely dry, turn the heat to low and add the bacon and the herbs, if you’re using them. Stir until combined.
3. Meanwhile, beat the eggs with the remaining ½ teaspoon salt and some pepper, along with the cheese. Pour over the vegetables, tilting the pan to distribute them evenly. Cook, undisturbed for about 5-10 minutes until the eggs are barely set. Then put the entire pan in the broiler for 1-2 minutes to finish setting the eggs and browning the top. Cut into wedges and serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.

### More Ideas

- You have lots of other options: spinach, chard, or broccoli raab; fresh or dried tomatoes; potato or sweet potato; asparagus; mushrooms; winter squash, carrots, or parsnips; even eggplant. The smaller you cut the vegetables, the sooner they’ll be ready for the eggs; just make sure the pan juices have evaporated before adding them.
- You can also make this frittata with 4 cups of cooked vegetables. Simply add them to the softened onion in Step 1;
- Add the herbs if you like, and cook for just 2 or 3 minutes before adding the egg.
