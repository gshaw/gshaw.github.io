    Had a bit of an exestential crisis about 1/3 into the book and had to pause to digest everything that I read.  Make sure you select a translation that works for you.

    I'm re-reading using the 1994 Ignat Avsey (Oxford) translation and really liking it.

    The novel annoyed me but for some reason I kept at it. I tries too hard to be a page turner using annoying techniques. At the end of each chapter to the point I made a mental note to skip the last paragraph in each chapter for this reason. The ending also needlessly explains the whole plot like a James Bond movie where the villain reveals the grand plan.

    I loved the premise and the issues that the book touched out. Many deep themes about betrayal, racism, love, sex, and illness. The biggest impact for me was showing the pandora's box scientific progress can open leaving humanity to deal with it the best it can.

    Amazing! The book is very dense but also very approachable. Some fine thinking and sometimes I was just having on to keep with the discussion.

    Written 60+ years ago but feels just if not more relevant today. Goes to show how human nature doesn't change.

    I really like Carl Sagan and the way he thinks.  Some sections in the book are a semi-dated (UFO sightings) but if you replace UFO with 5G the psychology still applies.

    The second part of the book and the final chapters were really good. If you like Carl Sagan and are interested in critical thinking and science you will like this book. If not but you are interested in liberty and freedom you will really like this book as it shows the role of education and democracy.

    After listening to Dan Carlin's Hardcore History episode "Human Resources" on the Atlantic Slave Trade I noticed he quoted from this book so thought I'd give it a read as I've had it on my list for years.

    Great read, and amazing primary source from a slave of that time. Incredible that he could teach himself to read and write under that situation. In many ways the book reminded me on "Man's Search For Meaning" for the strength of character Douglass has.

    Recommend for anybody interested in BLM, American History, and human rights. Read it while listening to Dan Carlin's podcast on the same topic for additional breadth.

    Hard to believe this was written by somebody so young. The character development and story is suburb. Only giving 4 stars because it still didn't grip me completely and found I had to push a bit to finish it.

    Update: I still think of the characters in this book years after reading it. The book gripped me more than I realized immediately after finishing.

    Was not expecting to gain so much insight about behaviour and psychology as I did from this book. Very interesting and very readable. What impressed me was how well the ideas he had were communicated in the book.

    The chapter on altruism and The Prisoner's Dilemma were especially interesting in explaining group behaviour during Covid restrictions.

    Brutal WW1 personal account from the German perspective. The author is a different breed if even half of what he wrote is true. The fact that he somehow lived through the ordeal is incredible. The vast waste of life and resources is sobering.

    I really want to give this book 3 stars and maybe fewer based on all the times I was yelling at the author. And yet I kept reading because he has some interesting points. The problem is all the side journeys you need to follow to get to the nuggets at the end I feel I missed half of the concepts.

    It doesn't help that the author is difficult to like.

    The book is about exactly what the subtitle says but you need to read the book to understand the importance of the topic with his examples. The gist being that humans aren't capable of thinking in terms of extreme events and so we ignore them and they cause great harm (or good). As the world is changing to produce more of these improbable events a new non-intuitive way of thinking is needed to help hedge against the impacts.

    I'm sure this is a horrible summary and the author would murder me with words or just as likely write me off as incompetent. I'm good with either either outcome.

    Wanted to read something to contrast "The Inconvenient Indian" I recently finished. Yikes, what a novel! Difficult and not an easy read but this one is going to stick with me for a while.

    Felt like a mash up between Quentin Tarantino and Henry David Thoreau. This is capital L Literature. Many times I read a page and was left not understanding what I was going on while at the same time feeling this is significant.

    This isn't for everybody but I'm glad to have read it and will try some more of his novels because of it.

    Can't rate this book high enough. I gained a huge amount of insight about my self. The book's material goes well beyond relationships and can impact any aspect of your life but the core message is about love and intimacy.

    The frank eroticism was surprising and tastefully done. I would recommend this book to anybody in a relationship or that wants to be in one.

    What a story and what a group of characters. Incredible story telling though. Writing isn't easy. Sometimes I found my mind wandering and wasn't sure if the writing was a bit too slow for me. When this happened I went back and re-read the pages and found that I missed a lot. If you stick with it though you end up with entirely different life etched into your mind which I love. Watching the AMC TV series now which helps bring the characters even more to life.

    The book was first published in 1983 and yet the politics haven't changed in the 41 years. The story could take place today. This is such a colossal failure of political leadership it boggles my mind.

    Read based on book recommendations from the Ezra Klein Show with Thomas Friedman (Jan 19, 2024).

    Cooking for people provides another way to love your friends and family that is difficult to describe until you do it. If you aren't comfortable cooking for a group do yourself a favor and learn.

    It is so enjoyable and refreshing when a book-story is the length it should be  I just loved the stories, lessons, and philosophy. So nice when somebody can explain the thoughts in your head better than you can so you can then share them and discuss them with others.

    I've heard Derek talk before and even remember the passion he had around learning Ruby on Rails back in the day. It's great to hear his story and the world is a better place for him being in it.

    Do yourself a favour and listen to the audiobook version even if you read the book.

    Fast paced, enjoyable fun read, not very deep.  Lots of interesting ideas around von Neumann probes (self replicating space craft). Maybe too much insider 20th century geeky references. The ending just stops so the three books in the series (I think) are really one book.  Not that this is a distraction but the material could be adapted well to a movie or TV series, which I'm sure the author had in mind when it was written.

    Didn't think I would find a book about American politics as interesting as I did. The writing and arguments are very compelling and helpful for understanding the specifics of U.S. politics but also what is generally happening in the world and Canada in regards to left-right wing ideologies and how they shape our current culture.

    After reading this I've been binging on the Erza Klein podcast which is also very good. Hilarious because I found out about Erza Klein when he did an interview with my favorite cookbook author Mark Bittman.

    What a great book! I've read a couple of critical thinking books in the last couple of years and this was by far the best. The use of stories and real examples makes understanding the fallacies and hazards to critical thinking much easier to understand and watch for.

    I suspect everybody reading this book will come across or at least recognize an example of where the thinking may have led them astray. Reading this book will help inoculate yourself from the reams of bad informations pushed by accident and on purpose.

    I think everybody would benefit and enjoy this is book. Even better, read it with a friend or in a group to stimulate discussion.

    Lots of great information in an easy to read format. The biggest idea I took from this was prioritizing relationships with people over being right.

    Being right is overrated in relationships. I'll never forget his example of a child scared of monsters under the bed and how arguing that the child is obviously only harms your relationship.
